Popular Swiss goat breeds include the Saanen goat, Toggenburg goat and the Chamois Coloured mountain goat. The white, short-haired Saanen goat is well suited for milk production. It originates from the Saanenland and Obersimmental regions. The Toggenburg goat is also a milk-producing breed. This breed is characterised by its long hair on its back and thighs. The Chamois Coloured mountain goat, which also produces good milk yields, has the most herdbook-registered animals. It is brown-black and thus resembles – as the name suggests – a chamois.

In addition to the main breeds, Switzerland is also home to endangered goat breeds. These include the Appenzell goat, the Bündner Strahlenziege, the Nera Verzasca, the Valais Blackneck and the Peacock goat. There are also imported breeds recognised in Switzerland such as the Anglo-Nubian, Boer goat and the Tauernscheck.
